A* program in order to solve 9 square puzzle problem.

Input:Two 9x9 square of number separated with space. The first one is your goal node, and
the second one is the start node.

Output:You will get a solution to the puzzle including every step that it took
in order to get the goal node.

The following is the A* algorithm.

Create a list called OpenList
Create a list called ClosedList

Create a new state for the initial node and the evaluate f*.

Insert new state s into OpenList

while OpenList is not empty
 current_node <- OpenList.pop();
 ClosedList.push( current_node );
 if ( current_node == goal )
    return current_node;
 else
    children_current_node <- expand(current_node);

 for each child j of current_node
   evaluate f* on each j
    if not member (OpenList) and not member (ClosedList)
      OpenList.insert(j);
      current_node.link(j);
   else
     if f* of j is bettern than f* of j in OpenList
       Replace(OpenList,j);
       current_node.link(j);
     if f* of j is better than f* of j value in ClosedList
     	ClosedList.remove(j);
	OpenList.insert(j);
	current_node.link(j);
